Terms of Service
This service is operated by Jianshuashua.

Welcome to the PCG HDA Toolset. By using our software, you agree to the following terms:

1. Free Trial Policy
We offer a 7-day free trial for any specific node within our toolset. Anyone is eligible to apply for a trial version to test compatibility and functionality before making a purchase.

2. Licensing & Refund Policy
Pre-purchase Testing: We strongly encourage users to utilize the 7-day trial period. A purchase should ideally be made once you are satisfied with the tool's performance.

Refund Requests: While we provide a free trial to ensure satisfaction, we offer a 14-day refund policy for technical issues that we are unable to resolve. If the software fails to function as described on your hardware after troubleshooting with our support, you may request a full refund within 14 days of purchase.

3. Updates & Maintenance
All future updates and improvements to the nodes you have purchased will be provided free of charge. We do not charge additional fees for version upgrades within the same product line.

4. License Activation & Technical Support
We offer different support levels based on the license type to ensure software security and user success:

Monthly Subscription Licenses: These licenses offer high flexibility. Users are entitled to request a hardware ID (HWID) migration to a new device once per billing cycle. We provide full technical support for this transition.

Perpetual (One-time) Licenses: These are "node-locked" licenses designed for a single hardware environment.

Support Scope: We provide comprehensive technical guidance, installation support, and deployment troubleshooting to ensure the tool functions correctly on the licensed hardware.

Hardware Changes: As perpetual licenses are discounted one-time purchases, hardware migrations are not provided by default. We encourage users to verify their environment using the 7-day trial before purchase.

General Commitment: In all cases of technical difficulty, we provide email support to assist with activation and ensure the toolset performs as described.

5. Limitation of Liability
The software is provided "as-is". We are not liable for any direct or indirect damages (including data loss or project delays) arising from the use of these tools.

Contact: If you have questions regarding these terms, please contact us via the email listed on our main page.
