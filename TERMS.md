# Terms of Service

Last updated: January 2026

Welcome to the PCG HDA Toolset. By using our software, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Free Trial Policy
We offer a **7-day free trial** for any specific node within our toolset. Anyone is eligible to apply for a trial version to test compatibility and functionality before making a purchase.

### 2. Licensing & Purchase
* **Pre-purchase Testing**: We strongly encourage users to utilize the 7-day trial period. A purchase should only be made once you are satisfied with the tool's performance.
* **Non-Refundable**: Due to the digital nature of our products and the provision of a pre-purchase trial, **all sales are final and non-refundable**.

### 3. Updates & Maintenance
All future updates and improvements to the nodes you have purchased will be provided **free of charge**. We do not charge additional fees for version upgrades within the same product line.

### 4. License Activation & Hardware Changes
* Licenses are bound to the specific hardware ID provided at the time of activation.
* **User Responsibility**: The seller is not responsible for license failure caused by hardware changes, system reinstallation, or other non-seller-related modifications on the user's side. 
* It is the user's responsibility to maintain the environment in which the license was activated.

### 5. Limitation of Liability
The software is provided "as-is". We are not liable for any direct or indirect damages (including data loss or project delays) arising from the use of these tools.
