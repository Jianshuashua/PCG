# Terms of Service

This service is operated by **Jianshuashua**.

Welcome to the PCG HDA Toolset. By using our software, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Free Trial Policy
We offer a **7-day free trial** for any specific node within our toolset. Anyone is eligible to apply for a trial version to test compatibility and functionality before making a purchase.

### 2. Licensing & Refund Policy
* **Pre-purchase Testing**: We strongly encourage users to utilize the 7-day trial period. A purchase should ideally be made once you are satisfied with the tool's performance.
* **Refund Requests**: While we provide a free trial to ensure satisfaction, we offer a **14-day refund policy** for technical issues that we are unable to resolve. If the software fails to function as described on your hardware after troubleshooting with our support, you may request a full refund within 14 days of purchase.

### 3. Updates & Maintenance
All future updates and improvements to the nodes you have purchased will be provided **free of charge**. We do not charge additional fees for version upgrades within the same product line.

### 4. License Activation & Support
* Licenses are bound to the specific hardware ID provided at the time of activation.
* **Hardware Changes**: In the event of hardware changes or system reinstallations, please contact our support team. We will assist in migrating your license to your new environment, provided it is for the same user.
* We aim to ensure a stable user experience and will provide reasonable technical support for activation-related issues.

### 5. Limitation of Liability
The software is provided "as-is". We are not liable for any direct or indirect damages (including data loss or project delays) arising from the use of these tools.
