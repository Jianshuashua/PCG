Pricing & Licensing
The PCG HDA Toolset offers flexible pricing based on the complexity of each module and your project requirements.

1. Individual Node Licenses (Monthly)
Pricing for individual nodes depends on the technical complexity and functionality.

Standard Nodes (e.g., Terrain/Mountain Generation): $30 / month / device

Advanced Nodes (e.g., River/Water Systems): $50 / month / device

Complex Systems (e.g., Advanced Road/City Systems): Starting from $400 / month / device

2. Annual Subscription Discount
We offer significant discounts for long-term users. All nodes are available at 50% off when billed annually.

Example: A $30/mo node would be $180/year ($15/mo equivalent).

3. Enterprise & Bulk Licensing
Volume Discount: For studios or teams requiring 10+ licenses, we offer specialized bulk pricing. Please contact us for a custom quote.

Custom Development: If you require custom features or bespoke HDA development, pricing is determined based on technical difficulty and development cycle.

4. Licensing Support
Monthly/Yearly Licenses: Include hardware migration support (once per billing cycle).

Perpetual Licenses: Available upon request for specific modules. Pricing is node-locked.
